<P style="margin:0px"><BR></P>

<P style="margin:0px; font-size:12pt" align=justify><B>WHEREAS, </B>Company desires to enter into this Agreement with Developer for certain services and the development of certain applications, as described further under this Agreement.</P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin:0px; font-size:12pt" align=justify><B>NOW, THEREFORE,</B> in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows: </P>
<P style="margin:0px" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="margin-top:6px; margin-bottom:0px; font-size:12pt" align=justify><B>1.</B> <B>SERVICES</B>. Developer will perform for Company, as a &#147;work made for hire&#148;, the services doe the development of a mobile game software application for iOS devices and Android OS devices, that are more particularly described in any schedules, invoices, purchase order or statements of work (&#147;hereinafter all referenced as &#147;Schedules&#148;) that the parties have executed, or may execute from time to time, which shall be and are hereby incorporated by reference and made a part of this Agreement. Any and all services and/or Schedules performed by Developer (hereinafter referred to as &#147;Work&#148;), may include, but are not limited to, the development and/or delivery of any software, applications, technologies, materials, inventions, ideas, designs, concepts, techniques, discoveries, or improvements created by Developer. Developer is not obligated to perform any Work, and Company has not contracted for any Work, unless and until a Schedule is executed by both parties. Both parties agree the requirement of a written signed Schedule is satisfied upon either (a)&nbsp;Developer and Company&#146;s signing a Schedule, or (b)&nbsp;Developer&#146;s commencing Work described in an electronic Schedule or purchase order transmitted by an authorized and designated Company employee. In the event that Developer performs and Company pays for any services without having executed a Schedule or any other written agreement applying to such services, then such services will constitute Work under this Agreement and will be governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Developer agrees to deliver final software applications (and all source code and object code related thereto) to Company no later than 6 months after receiving the $5,000 payment, described in Section 5, to commence activities related to the Work described in the Schedule.</P>

ACCEPTANCE PROCESS.</B> Unless provided otherwise in the applicable Schedule, Company will have forty-five (45)&nbsp;days following delivery of any Work in which to evaluate the Work and any portion thereof and submit a written notice of acceptance or rejection to Developer, or such other longer time as is reasonable under the circumstances. Company may accept or reject Work based on its failure to conform to any Schedule, specifications or warranties or its being unfit for Company&#146;s intended purpose. No Work shall be deemed accepted absent Company&#146;s written acknowledgement of its acceptance to Developer and shall therefore constitute Developer&#146;s rejection of Work. In the event of Developer&#146;s rejection of any Work, Developer will promptly correct the Work. If Developer fails to correct the Work within fifteen (15)&nbsp;days after notice of rejection or other reasonable period agreed to by the parties, Company may terminate the applicable Work to this Agreement, or the applicable portion thereof, and receive a full refund of amounts paid under such Schedule for the rejected Work.</P>

To the extent applicable, Developer agrees to pay all applicable taxes levied on it by a duly constituted and authorized taxes authority on the transactions covered under this Agreement. To the extent required by any such taxing authority , Developer may collect such taxes, if any, from Company solely based on the amounts payable under this Agreement (such taxes the &#147;Collected Taxes&#148;), and in such case, company shall remit to Company official tax certificates indicating that such taxes have been collected by Developer and submitted to the appropriate tax authorities. Developer will take such steps as are requested by Company to minimize such Collected Taxes in accordance with all relevant laws and to cooperate with and assist Company, at Company&#146;s request, in challenging the validity of any Collected Taxes or taxes otherwise paid by Company. Developer will equally share the cost of any successful Company-initiated ruling and/or appeal or other determination that concludes that the Collected Taxes are not owed in whole or in part under this Agreement.
